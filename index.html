  <div class="col-sm-6"><font color="#000099"><h3><center><em>Work History</em></center></h3>     I am in the process of changing careers from fitness to web development. For the last few years, I worked as a personal trainer at several gyms in New Jersey and New York City. Initially, fitness was a rewarding field.  However, the uncertainty of signing on clients, the drastic shifts in new business depending on the season , and the need for more predictable hours necessitated a change; I enrolled in Rutgers Coding Bootcamp after consulting a career advisor at my alma mater. I look forward to pursuing a career as front end web developer: It affords a greater amount of creative liberty than back end.</font> </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">&#160;&#160;&#160;<font color="#ccccff"><h3><center><em>Education</em></center></h3>I graduated from high school in 2005 and graduated from college in 2008 & 2010. I have an Associates of Science Degree in Criminal Justice from County College of Morris and a Bachelors of Arts in History from the University of Maine in Orono. In five years of college, I only missed only one class and that was because I was still memorizing the schedule. I also have two primary personal trainer certifications and four specialties. </font>

One of my proudest accomplishments is losing 100 pounds; it took 15 months to lose and I have kept it off since April 2006. Some of my interests include running, strength training, playing chess, reading history, solving crossword puzzles, and playing airsoft.</font></div>
