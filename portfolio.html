  <div class="col-sm-9"><h3><em>Work History</em></h3> I am currently looking to change careers. For the last few years, I worked as a personal trainer at several gyms in New Jersey and New York City. Initially, fitness was a rewarding field; eventually I became tired of seeing my clients treated like nothing more than a spreadsheet cell by bureaucrats. </div>

  <div class="col-sm-6">&#160;&#160;&#160;<h3><em>Education</em></h3>I graduated from high school in 2005 and graduated from college in 2008& 2010. I have an Associates of Science Degree in Criminal Justice from County College of Morris and a Bachelors of Arts in History from the University of Maine in Orono. In five years of college, I only missed only one class and that was because I was still memorizing the schedule. I also have two primary personal trainer certifications and four specialties.

One of my proudest accomplishments is losing 100 pounds; it took 15 months to lose and I have kept it off since April 2006. Some of my interests include playing chess, reading history, solving crossword puzzles, and playing airsoft.</div>
